How to Use and Test

    Instantiate the Module: Connect the direct_mapped_cache module between your CPU model and your main memory model.

    CPU Connection:

        Connect cpu_addr, cpu_read, cpu_write, and cpu_wdata.

        The CPU must monitor cpu_wait. If cpu_wait is high, the CPU must stall its pipeline and hold its request signals (cpu_addr, etc.) constant until cpu_wait goes low.

    Memory Connection:

        Connect mem_addr, mem_read, mem_write, and mem_wdata to your main memory module.

        Your memory module must provide a mem_wait signal. When the cache asserts mem_read or mem_write, the memory should assert mem_wait high until the operation is complete. The cache will wait for this signal to go low before proceeding.

This design provides a solid foundation for a CPU cache system. It correctly implements the direct-mapped logic and handles the essential hit/miss and write-back scenarios.
