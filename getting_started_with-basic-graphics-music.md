Beginner's guide to Basic-graphics-music examples
==================================================

These are examples to demonstrate labs sessions for [systemverilog-homework](https://github.com/yuri-panchul/systemverilog-homework) which are portable  
examples for ASIC and FPGA.  

These examples facilitate learning for beginners by:-  

1. Removing EDA and FPGA vendor complexity and restrictions.
2. Compensating the gap between academia and industry in solving microarchitectural 
   problems  
	 necessary for a career in ASIC design, building CPU, GPU and networking chips.
3. Reducing the barrier of entry for them or a person who is transitioning to FPGA/ASIC design.


Requirements:-

1. Ubuntu 23.10,supports latest icarus verilog 12, other versions of linux are supported also.
2. git.
3. FPGA board, the examples support 30 boards with FPGAs from Xilinx,Altera, Gowin and Lattice and  
   aim to be compatible with open-source ASIC design tools.  

A List of boards for various FPGA vendors:-  

![List of boards](https://github.com/sisaphilip/myconfigs/blob/main/Pictures/boards.png)


Step 1 download Intel Quartus
-----------------------------

[Go to](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/795187/intel-quartus-prime-lite-edition-design-software-version-23-1-for-linux.html)
and download Quartus Lite Edition 23.1. This version needs no license to generate files to program the FPGA  

![download page](https://github.com/sisaphilip/myconfigs/blob/main/Pictures/0.png)


Step 2 Running the installer
----------------------------

Right click on installer and select properties.  

![Right click on installer and go to properties](https://github.com/sisaphilip/myconfigs/blob/main/Pictures/1.png)

Set installer executable as program.

Installation Completed

Step 3 Running Quartus
----------------------

Double click on desktop icon **OR** Navigate to installation directory in bin directory in command line and type  

> ./quartus  

![GUI](https://github.com/sisaphilip/myconfigs/blob/main/Pictures/8.png)  

Step 4 Installing git
---------------------

Open terminal and type  

> sudo apt-get install git  

Step 5 git clone Basic-graphics-music
------------------------------------

In terminal, at a desired location clone the main directory from github  

> git clone https://github.com/yuri-panchul/basics-graphics-music  

Step 6 Setup and Sellecting FPGA board.
-----------------------------
Connect your FPGA board via usb cable  

![board connection](https://github.com/sisaphilip/myconfigs/blob/main/Pictures/b0.jpg)  

Open the cloned directory on your pc in terminal  


![CLI](https://github.com/sisaphilip/myconfigs/blob/main/Pictures/mm0.png) you can  

> git pull  

To update to the new version.  

Run the bash script  
> ./check_setup_and_choose_fpga_board.bash  

Sellect the corresponding number of your boards DE10-lite is 16 and press ENTER The number might change depending  
on cloned version of the directory. Some old boards that are not supported by Quartus 23.1 can be used by of the  
software.  

![Board sellection](https://github.com/sisaphilip/myconfigs/blob/main/Pictures/mm0.png)  

Choose N when prompted with choice to use Qurtus GUI The reason for N is because  
you what to run one example after which you can try the rest.

Step 7 Running Shift register example
-------------------------------------

Navigate to shift register example by typing  

> cd labs/08_shift_register  

![08 shift register example location](https://github.com/sisaphilip/myconfigs/blob/main/Pictures/mm3.png)  

To Run synthesis in **CLI** run the script  

> ./03_synthesize_for_fpga.bash  

![Run synthesis script](https://github.com/sisaphilip/myconfigs/blob/main/Pictures/mm4.png)  

During synthesis a directory Run is generated, containing necessary files for programming the FPGA, after which the  
programmer is run by the same script to program the board using the files. After a **successful!!** synthesis the response should be as bellow.  

![success display](https://github.com/sisaphilip/myconfigs/blob/main/Pictures/mm5.png)  

Ensure all the LED switches are off All switches should be down because the left switch is used as a reset.

The image bellow illustrates how a shift register works.  

![register](https://github.com/sisaphilip/myconfigs/blob/main/Pictures/register.png)  

Press Reset button, KEY 0 to observe how logic 1 get shifted accross the registers If you use another board,  
not DE10-Lite, reset might be allocated to another button.

You can run other scripts in the directory depending on what you want to do
